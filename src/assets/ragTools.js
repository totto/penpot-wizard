      Use this tool to search the Penpot user guide and documentation. This tool can find specific information about Penpot features, components, and usage instructions.

      IMPORTANT: All queries to this tool must be in English.

      QUERY CONSTRUCTION RULES:
      - ALWAYS expand user queries with specific Penpot technical terms
      - Include multiple relevant concepts from the available list below
      - Use the format: "[user intent] + [specific tool] + [method] + [technical terms]"
      - Never use generic queries - always include Penpot-specific terminology

      QUERY TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLES:
      ❌ Bad: "how to draw triangle"
      ✅ Good: "how to draw triangle using path tool bezier curves nodes vector shapes"

      ❌ Bad: "create button"  
      ✅ Good: "how to create button component rectangle styling flex layout"

      ❌ Bad: "center elements"
      ✅ Good: "how to align center distribute layers flex layout grid positioning"

      MANDATORY TECHNICAL TERMS TO INCLUDE:
      - For shapes: "path tool", "bezier", "nodes", "vector shapes", "boolean operations"
      - For design: "components", "layers", "styling", "flex layout", "grid layout"
      - For interactions: "prototyping", "triggers", "actions", "flows", "overlays"

      Available concepts in the Penpot user-guide:

      **Core Objects & Tools:**
      - Boards: Containers for designs, can be resized, clipped, used as screens
      - Rectangles & Ellipses: Basic geometric shapes (shortcuts: R, E)
      - Text: Text layers with typography options, alignment, sizing
      - Paths (Bezier): Vector paths with nodes, curves, editing capabilities (shortcut: P), valid to draw complex shapes like stars, polygons, etc.
      - Curves (Freehand): Freehand drawing tool (shortcut: Shift+C)
      - Images: Import, aspect ratio control, positioning

      **Layer Management:**
      - Pages: Organize layers into separate sections
      - Layers Panel: View, select, hide, lock layers
      - Groups: Combine layers for simultaneous operations
      - Masks: Clipping layers to show only parts of other layers
      - Boolean Operations: Union, difference, intersection, exclusion, flatten
      - Constraints: Control how layers behave when resizing containers

      **Styling & Visual Effects:**
      - Color Fills: Custom colors, gradients (linear/radial), images, opacity
      - Strokes: Color, width, position, style (solid/dotted/dashed), caps/arrows
      - Border Radius: Customize rectangle/image corners
      - Shadows: Drop/inner shadows with position, blur, spread
      - Blur: Apply blur effects to objects
      - Blend Modes: Normal, multiply, screen, overlay, etc.
      - Opacity: Overall layer transparency

      **Layouts & Positioning:**
      - Flex Layout: CSS Flexbox-based flexible layouts
      - Grid Layout: CSS Grid-based 2D layouts with rows/columns
      - Alignment: Align and distribute layers
      - Positioning: Static, absolute positioning
      - Z-index: Layer stacking order

      **Components & Libraries:**
      - Components: Reusable objects with main/copy relationships
      - Component Variants: Group similar components with properties
      - Asset Libraries: Store components, colors, typography
      - Shared Libraries: Publish and connect libraries across files

      **Prototyping & Interactions:**
      - Prototype Mode: Connect boards for interactive prototypes
      - Triggers: On click, mouse enter/leave, after delay
      - Actions: Navigate, open/toggle/close overlays, previous screen, open URL
      - Animations: Dissolve, slide, push transitions
      - Flows: Multiple starting points for different user journeys

      **Advanced Features:**
      - Custom Fonts: Install and use custom typography
      - Design Tokens: Manage consistent design values
      - Exporting: Export designs in various formats
      - Inspect Mode: Get CSS properties and code
      - View Mode: Present and share prototypes
      - Teams: Collaborative features

      REMEMBER: Penpot doesn't have specific tools for every shape. Always search for alternative methods using existing tools like Path tool, Boolean operations, or combining basic shapes.
